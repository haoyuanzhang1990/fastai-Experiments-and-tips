# FastAI-Experiments
My experiments and progress within various fastai applications

Here is where I will be posting any experiments regarding the fastai library before I publish them anywhere

### Class Imbalances:
  * Explores over/under/moderate sampling
  
### Encoder-ish
  * Slight experimental encoder-inspired layer setup
  
### Feature Importance
  * Permutation importance in the fastai library
  
### Hidden Layer Sizes
  * An attempt to find some mathematical way to 
  calculate the size for hidden layers on tabular models
  
### KeyPoints
  * An example of how to deal with key points when they go off-image after transforms
  
### Test Set Generation
  * A walkthrough on how to generate labeled test-sets in the fastai library and integrate them into a Learner
